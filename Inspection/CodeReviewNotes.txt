1. Separation of concerns. Lots going on in Activity. Business logic in Activity will be hard to test independent of a running app. Easier to understand if business logic is separate from UI code. Refactoring to fix it: extract method, extract class.

2. Some variables have package scope. Scope should be tight as possible.

3. In the AsyncTask doInBackground writes to contactList which onPostExecute reads. With an AsyncTask, doInBackground can return a value which is passed to onPostExecute. This would avoid passing data through a global variable.

4. fileManipulation.loadVariableFromFile() throws an exception if file not found. loadVariableFromFile throws IOException but catch block in findRealms() catches FIleNotFound. Also, is this a good use of exceptions? Seems to be using exception processing for normal/regular code (not an error or unexpected event).

5. Are you opening file twice in loadVariableFromFile()?
